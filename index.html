      My name is Luis Alejandro Almanza Jr.; I am currently a junior Computer Science undergraduate student at Texas A&M University 
      minoring in Game Design and Development. During my time here so far, I have taken many intensive computer science courses that
      have introduced me to many of the intricacies this degree has to offer, which has only developed my skills far beyond what they 
      were before arriving here. In addition, I've taken advantage of the social/networking opportunities here and have participated 
      in the Texas A&M Game Developers organization, the Aggie Coding Club, and in Texas A&M's chapter of the Society of Professional
      Hispanic Engineers (SHPE), Texas A&M's Computer Society, and Texas A&M's Datathon.</br></br>

      I'm proud to call Laredo, Texas my lifelong home due to being able to grow up in a culturally enriched community. Growing up 
      there has provided me with a lifestyle perspective/model of a proper work ethic and general socialization with people from different 
      backgrounds as Laredo continued to expand industrially and people of many origins made Laredo their new home. Ever since I was young, 
      I've always been fascinated with computers but I wasn't quite sure what about them tickled my brain so much until I attended a game
      development summer program during middle school. Since then, I knew that I wanted to pursue a major in computer science while gaining 
      more knowledge on the industry standard for game development. On this website, you'll find a portfolio showcasing some of my projects 
      with links to their GitHub pages, some of my technical qualifications and resume, a recounting of some of my public services done 
      through mentorship and volunteer work, and lastly, a page constructed entirely with AI (more specifically ChatGPT)! This AI section 
      should detail some of the major achievements/importance of video game design and development.
